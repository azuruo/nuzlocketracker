# Pokemon Save Tracker

Welcome to your Pokemon Save Tracker!

The main purpose of this app is to be used as a companion to your own personal 'Nuzlocke' playthrough of any Pokemon game.

All you do is select the pokemon you're using from the dropdown, and you'll be able to keep track of your encounters, losses, and upcoming bosses.
